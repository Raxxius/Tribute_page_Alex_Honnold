            <h2 class="tribute-heading tribute-title">Climbing</h2>
            <p class="tribute-text">Alexander Honnold, born in Sacramento, California on the 17 August 1985, is a climber who specialises in 'big wall' climbing. He is most famous for being the first person to climb a route up El Capitan free solo (without protective gear and ropes); a feat captured in the video documentary Free Solo. Honnold has tackled a number of climbing challenges that simply boggle the normal persons mind.
            <h3 class="tribute-heading">Achievements include:</p>

                        <p class="tribute-text"> Alex climbed El Capitan with the aid of only a pair of La Sportiva TC Pro climbing shoes and a chalk bag. On May 3, 2017, he ascended the Freerider line in 3 hours and 56 minutes, beginning at 5:32 am and reaching the peak at 9:28 am.</p>
                    
                        <p class="tribute-text">The feat was captured by Alex's long time friend and professional photographer and film maker, <span><a href="https://jimmychin.com">Jimmy Chin</a></span> in the documentary Free Solo.</p>

                        <p class="tribute-text">After completing the climb, Alex went back to his camper van to train hangs. When asked why, he said "but I've been trying to hangboard every other day, and it's the other day."</p>

            <p class="tribute-text">"I live out of my van, which gives me a first-hand appreciation for power and lighting. A few years ago, I rebuilt the interior of my van to include solar panels and a battery that powers LEDs for lighting and allows me to charge my phone and laptop."</p>

            <p>Founded by professional rock climber Alex Honnold in 2012, the charity has the purpose of installing solar power in impoverished communities.</p>

            <p>Alex focused on solar energy because of it's ease to setup in remote communties, and the Honnald Foundation supports community scale projects that increase climate resilience, bolster social and economic equity, reduce environmental impact, and improve peoples' lives.</p>
