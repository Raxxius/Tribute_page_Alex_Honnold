            <p class="tribute-text">Alexander Honnold, born in Sacramento, California on the 17 August 1985, is a climber who specialises in 'big wall' climbing. He is most famous for being the first person to climb a route up El Capitan free solo (without protective gear and ropes); a feat captured in the video documentary Free Solo. Honnold has tackled a number of climbing challenges that simply boggle the normal persons mind.
